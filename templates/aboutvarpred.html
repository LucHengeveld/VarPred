                <p>What started as a start-up from the Hogeschool Arnhem & Nijmegen (HAN) in 2021 has grown considerably in recent months into a hard-working company with a strong biological DNA. From Nijmegen we support our users in achieving clinical significance. VarPred is successful in various market segments such as healthcare and the government. We have now grown into partners of HAN. We are very proud of that. VarPred strives for challenging solutions for the user. Our mission is to help users determine their clinical significance. For now, we only support a clinical significance predictor to give users a clear picture of their health. We do this with the help of Machine Learning in combination with Flask.
