            <p>What started as a start-up from the Hogeschool Arnhem & Nijmegen
                (HAN) in 2021 has grown considerably in recent months into a
                hard-working company with a strong biological DNA. From
                Nijmegen we support our users in achieving clinical
                significance. VarPred is successful in various market segments
                such as healthcare and the government. We have now grown into
                partners of HAN. We are very proud of that. VarPred strives for
                challenging solutions for the user. Our mission is to help
                users determine their clinical significance. For now, we only
                support a clinical significance predictor to give users a clear
                picture of their health. We do this with the help of Machine
                Learning in combination with Flask.
